 Check for valid filetypes in WSL
 
 Used for double checking that I haven't put files into the wrong folders prior to bagging.
 
 Designed for use on Windows in WSL environment. Accepts a directory and then asks user if they are searching in a folder meant for pres copies or access copies. Then recursively searches folder and prints files that are the wrong extension.
